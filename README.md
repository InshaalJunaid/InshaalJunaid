### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I'm Inshaal
<h2>Data Engineering Learning Journey</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
Welcome to my Data Engineering Learning Journey repository! I'm a Grade 10 student at BVS Parsi High School, currently diving into the fascinating world of data engineering through a course with Saylani Welfare International Trust. This repository documents my progress, projects, and learnings as I explore various tools and technologies in the field.

<h4>Goals:</h4>
* Learn Python: Mastering Python is the first step in my data engineering journey. I'll be exploring Python's capabilities for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

* Understanding Databases: With a focus on MySQL, I aim to comprehend database management systems, querying data, and building efficient databases.

* Exploring AWS Services: Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a plethora of services for data engineering. I'll be delving into AWS tools for storage, computation, and deployment.

* Utilizing Libraries: I'll be experimenting with popular Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup for web scraping and Icecream for debugging, enhancing my data processing skills.
<h4>Contents</h4>
* Python Scripts: This folder contains Python scripts I've written to practice various data manipulation tasks and algorithms.
* AWS Projects: I'll be sharing my experiments and projects involving AWS services like S3, EC2, and RDS.
* Libraries Exploration: Documentation and code snippets exploring the functionalities of libraries like Beautiful Soup and Icecream.
<h4>Projects</h4>
* Web Scraping Project: I'm working on a project to scrape data from websites using Beautiful Soup, aiming to gather insights or build datasets for analysis.
* Data Visualization: Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I'll be creating visual representations of data to convey meaningful insights.
* AWS Deployment: As part of my AWS exploration, I plan to deploy a simple web application or data pipeline on AWS infrastructure.
<h4>Contributions</h4>
I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from fellow learners and data enthusiasts. Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or reach out for collaboration opportunities!
<h2>Happy learning, and let's explore the world of data engineering together!</h2>
